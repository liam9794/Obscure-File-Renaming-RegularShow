# Obscure-File-Renaming-RegularShow
Used to restructure the naming scheme of Regular Show.

I wanted to rename all of the episodes of Regular Show to follow the same naming scheme as Hulu.
I didn't want to edit 261 files by hand.
I like coding.

I tested it on season 2 since it has a handful of renamed episodes, and a handful that aren't.
I also made sure it recurrs through directories correctly even though season 2 was the only directory with files in it.
I will test it on the full 8 seasons later, and update the README!
