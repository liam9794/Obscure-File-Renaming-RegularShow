# Obscure-File-Renaming-RegularShow
Used to restructure the naming scheme of Regular Show.

I wanted to rename all of the episodes of Regular Show to follow the same naming scheme as Hulu.
I didn't want to edit 261 files by hand.
I like coding.

It's tested on all 8 seasons and it works great! 
It's not PERFECT, for example titles with numbers won't be spaced correctly, but I can't satisfy every single case. For example, "1000th" shouldn't be spaced, but "150 Piece" should be spaced. "TGITuesday" should be spaced like "TGI Tuesday", not "T G I Tuesday" but "ARegular" should be "A Regular".
I'm happy. Maybe I edit ten episodes by hand instead of 261 *shrug*.

Instructions: All you do is start the program, and paste the file path to the overarching folder, eg: "Regular Show".
Navigate to where your "Regular Show" folder is located, right-click, click "Copy as path", and then paste it into the program and watch the magic happen!
